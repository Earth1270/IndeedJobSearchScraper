# IndeedJobSearchScraper
Scraping job search results using Indeeds API

Each of these scripts has different features

The most updated script is the one that saves to csv -- this one does not loop through search terms

I've been working on a GUI, but it just seems like a hell of alot of work for nothing 
Its really not that hard to install python and modify the script to add the features of your choosing.
